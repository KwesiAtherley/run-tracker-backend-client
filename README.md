### Build Process

 Due to this being my first attempt at building both a front-end client and back-end api.The goal was to keep the application as simple as possible. While using the techniques and methods we learned in the second unit of the program.
 Focused on building out the API aspect of the project first, then moved on to the front end and finally some light css to make the application as presentable as possible.
 Still to be addressed - making the application truly mobile friendly and more aesthetically pleasing. Also adding additional usable features.
